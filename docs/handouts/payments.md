## Info

> **Note**
> This project integrates with Stripe, an access key and secret key are required and can be provided. Alternatively, you can create an account  and produce your own _**test**_ keys.

The frontend will [pre-authorise](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) the credit card for you. After it's performed the pre-authorization, the frontend will call the payments servie to notify it about the transaction.

Whilst performing the booking, the booking service will notify the payment service to complete the transaction.

## Initial OpenAPI
The OpenAPI snippet will get you started for your service, other endpoints will need to be created by your team to complete the event.
