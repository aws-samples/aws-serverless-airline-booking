The front-end is built atop Vue.js, and uses Vuex modules to integrate with its back-ends.

## Modules

These are the Vuex modules that manipulate the state, and integrate with each back-end hosted at AWS:

Component | Functionality | Description
------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Catalog | Flight search | Searches for flights given a destination and departure date.
Booking | Bookings | Creates and lists bookings for customers.
Loyalty | Loyalty | Fetches Loyalty points for customers including tiers, and calculates how far they are from the next tier.
Profile | Customer profile | Provides authenticated user information to other components such as JWT tokens (user attributes, etc.). It may be extended to create an actual profile service on the back-end.

## Shared

Shared classes and mixins (e.g. filters) can be found are `shared` - They permutate data that need to be represented in a slightly different format.

## Conventions

We use the following conventions to ease maintenance as we grow the number of modules and services:

* **Actions** - All interactions with back-ends regardless of its communication channel happen within each module's actions.js
* **Mutation** - State isn't mutated directly but through mutations functions (e.g. `SET_BOOKINGS`) and are always uppercase
* **GraphQL** - Custom GraphQL operations have a dedicated file close to its module (e.g. `catalog/graphql.js`)
* **Shared Models** - Data permutation such as formatting flight departure dates differently are done at a class property level e.g. (e.g. `FlightClass`)
* **Code documentation** - We document following JSDoc convention

## Running locally

You can run the front-end locally while targeting the back-end and auth deployed in your AWS account. 

If you followed the deployment instructions, you should have  `src/frontend/aws-exports.js` file.

Once you're all set, install front-end dependencies and run a local copy:

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn serve`

### I don't have aws-exports, or deleted accidentally

1. Open up your deployed App in Amplify Console by running `amplify console`
2. At the bottom of the page under **Edit your backend**, copy and run the `amplify pull` command
    - e.g. `amplify pull --appId d34s789vnlqyw4 --envName twitch`

> NOTE: **Aws-exports** is a configuration file for AWS Amplify library containing Cognito User Pools, AppSync  API, and what authentication mechanism it should use along with its region.
