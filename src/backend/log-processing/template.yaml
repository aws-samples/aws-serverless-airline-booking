Description: >
  Log Processing utilities stack.
  Provides a dedicated Kinesis stream for log ingestion.
  Subscribe new and existing Lambda function logs named `Airline` to Kinesis
  and only log entries that have `REPORT` or `MONITORING` as strings
  Expire ALL log entries after 14 days
  Creates Custom Metrics for Memory Used, Size, and Estimated Cost for each function and version
  Also creates custom metrics based on "MONITORING|<metric_value>|<metric_unit>|<metric_name>|<namespace>|<dimensions>" format

        ApplicationId: arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:374852340823:applications/async-custom-metrics
        SemanticVersion: 1.7.0
      Parameters:
        # What's the event source you will intend to use? If logs are pushed from CloudWatch Logs to Lambda directly, then use 'Lambda'. If logs are pushed to a Kinesis Stream first, then use 'Kinesis'. Other event sources are not supported (yet).
        EventSourceType: "Kinesis" # Uncomment to override default value
        # (optional) Only relevant to the Kinesis event source type. The ARN to the Kinesis stream to  subscribe the function to.
        KinesisStreamArn: !Sub ${LogProcessingStream.Arn} # Uncomment to override default value
        # (optional) Only relevant to the Kinesis event source type. The batch size to use for the  subscription.
        # KinesisStreamBatchSize: '100' # Uncomment to override default value
        # (optional) Timeout for the Lambda function that would ship metrics to CloudWatch. Defaults to 30s.
        # TimeoutSeconds: '30' # Uncomment to override default value
        # (optional) Whether to report init duration for Lambda functions as metrics. Allowed values are "true" or "false".
        # RecordLambdaColdStartMetric: 'true' # Uncomment to override default value
        # (optional) Whether to report estimated cost for Lambda functions as metrics. Allowed values are "true" or "false".
        # RecordLambdaCostMetric: 'true' # Uncomment to override default value
        # (optional) Whether to collect Lambda usage metrics (i.e. billed duration, memory size,  max memory used) from the logs and turn them into metrics. Allowed values are "true" or "false".
        # RecordLambdaUsageMetrics: 'true' # Uncomment to override default value

      Parameters:
        # The number of days to retain logs in CloudWatch Logs for.
        RetentionDays: "14" # Uncomment to override default value

  # Subscribe new and existing CloudWatch Log groups to ship logs to Kinesis

      Parameters:
        # The ARN of the Lambda function or Kinesis stream to subscribe a newly created CloudWatch log group to
        DestinationArn: !Sub ${LogProcessingStream.Arn}
        ## Disables processing of own logs

        # Only subscribe to functions created for this project
        ## Otherwise we'd override all CloudWatch Logs by subscribing to our Kinesis
        Prefix: "/aws/lambda/Airline" # Uncomment to override default value
        # Only captures REPORT and Custom Metrics log events; reduces cost and unnecessary noise

Outputs:
  LogProcessingStream:
    Value: !Sub ${LogProcessingStream.Arn}
